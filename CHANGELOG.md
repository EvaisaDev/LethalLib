## LethalLib [0.16.0]

### Added
- Version 50 moons were finally added to the `LevelTypes` enum.
- LethalLib weathers now also get added to LethalLevelLoader moons.

### Changed
- Use `TryGotoNext` instead of `GotoNext` for `StackFrame.AddFrames` ILHook so it doesn't throw if sequence was not found due to another mod patching the method first ([#74](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/LethalLib/pull/74))
- Added a reference to a `ToString` weather enum Hook ([#81](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/LethalLib/pull/81))

### Fixed
- `RemoveWeather`'s first argument was named "levelName", now it is "weatherName".

## LethalLib [0.15.1]

### Fixed
- Custom DungeonFlow registration has been disabled to prevent issues when using mod in current v50 beta versions.

## LethalLib [0.15.0]

### Added
- LethalLib will now also register enemies and items for when LethalLevelLoader adds its moons.

### Changed
- customLevelRarities will now accept the original level name or the level name modified by LethalLevelLoader, meaning enemies and items can target a custom moon using either name

### Fixed
- Enemy and item spawn weights now get applied as one would expect
  - `Levels.LevelTypes.All` no longer overrrides all spawn weights
  - `Levels.LevelTypes.Modded` now applies its spawn weights
    - this used to only apply its weight if customLevelRarities contained the level's name
  - customLevelRarities now applies its weights
